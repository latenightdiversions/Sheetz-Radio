# Sheetz-Radio
Pulls the name of the song currently playing at Sheetz stores and then plays the song.

This project very well may be the most pointless and poorly written code in decades, so if you stumble upon this and have the slightest clue on improvements, don't be afraid to tell us how to improve, or simply submit a pull request.

This project is purely an excuse to learn a little Python and for fun. I do not expect anybody to honestly use this.

COMPLETED:
- Fetch metadata of current song

TODO:
- CLI, GUI, and desktop widget versions (Conky).
- Cross platform support (Linux/Windows/Android...?)
- Ability to stream the song, so that one can experience the feeling of Sheetz in the comfort of their home.

TBD:
- Find a more productive use of my time.
